# Tutorial on Docker Compose 2 | Gateway

## Objective
This tutorial is the second tutorial in the docker-compose series and focuses on gateways and reverse proxying. It also underscores the importance of not exposing all endpoints to the outside world and stresses on the concept of abstraction. [Click here](https://github.com/scalable-web-systems/docker-compose-node) to navigate to the first tutorial in this series to learn more about docker-compose.

## Prerequisites
