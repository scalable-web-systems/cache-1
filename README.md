# Tutorial on Caching
> **Author -** Ishaan Khurana, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ishaan-khurana-46968679/)

## Objective
This tutorial is the first tutorial in the **caching** series. We'll be learning about caching and its importance, different cache eviction and write policies, various tradeoffs to keep in mind when applying these write policies. Finally, we'll be inspecting the source code and going over the implementation of a Linked List based LRU cache.

## Prerequisites
##### Side note: There are links attached to the bottom of this tutorial for our readers who may not be familiar with the technologies used here.
1. The reader should have completed the [first](https://github.com/scalable-web-systems/docker-compose-node), [second](https://github.com/scalable-web-systems/docker-compose-gateway) and [third](https://github.com/scalable-web-systems/docker-compose-mongo) of **Docker compose** series. 
2. The reader should have a working knowledge of Linked Lists and Maps. Additionally, the reader should also be aware of how a linked list is implemented under the hood.
3. The reader should be familiar with axios, asynchrous operations, promises, etc.
4. The reader should have PostMan installed on their machine. Alternatively, one can use CLI tools such as Curl, WGet etc. to make the API calls.
5. The reader should clone this repository to their local machine before moving on to the next section.

## Let's Look at the Code



## Steps

**IMPORTANT:** Create a new folder called **data** in the root directory of the cloned repository before performing the steps.

Perform the steps outlined in [Tutorial 2](https://github.com/scalable-web-systems/docker-compose-gateway) of **Docker Compose** series. We'll be inspecting logs to understand how the reads and writes are being peformed. 

## Conclusion
After doing this tutorial, one should have a firm grasp on caching fundamentals. Additionally, one should be able to create their own LRU cache.
